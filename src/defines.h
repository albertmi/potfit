 *  SLOTS: number of different distance tables used in the force calculations
 *
 *  In potfit all potentials are calculated via spline interpolations of pre-
 *  calculated potential tables. To speed up the spline calculation,
 *  the exact position of a neighbor distance has to be known with respect to the
 *  tabulated values. For each potential function in a force routine there should
 *  be a different slot with the corresponding potential table information.
 *
 *  SLOTS = 1 for the following interactions:
 *      PAIR, COULOMB, DIPOLE, TERSOFF
 *      0 ... pair distance
 *
 *  EAM:        SLOTS = 2
 *      0 ... pair distance
 *      1 ... transfer function
 *
 *  STIWEB:     SLOTS = 2
 *      0 ... pair distance
 *      1 ... exponential functions
 *
 *  TBEAM:      SLOTS = 3
 *      0 ... pair distance
 *      1 ... transfer function
 *      2 ... 2nd transfer function
 *
 *  MEAM:       SLOTS = 3
 *      0 ... pair distance
 *      1 ... transfer function
 *      2 ... f(r_ij)
 *
 *  ADP:        SLOTS = 4
 *      0 ... pair distance
 *      1 ... transfer function
 *      2 ... dipole term
 *      3 ... quadrupole term
